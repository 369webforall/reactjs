# Reactjs

## Chapter 1 - Reactjs Basic concept

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

## Create React App

Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it only creates frontend.
You can use any database.
Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack for compiling your code

When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder.

# Installing and Creating New React Application

- Install Nodejs
- VS code

Now create React folder in your computer eg. Desktop then open that in VS code editor .
Open the terminal in VS Code
and run below command.

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Folder structure

- **Assignment 1** : If we delete `node_modules`. How to run our app again successfully ?

```
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

```

Above code is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript.
JSX produces React “elements”

## Why JSX?

With JSX we can coupled UI and logic in same file.

## Embedding Expressions in JSX

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX

```
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

```

In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function,formatName(user), into an <h1> element.

```
const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

```

## Rendering an Element into the DOM

Let’s say there is a <div> somewhere in your HTML file:

```
<div id="root"></div>

```

```
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById('root')
);
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
root.render(element);

```

## Chapter 2 - Components - JSX and Props

Component is just JavaScript function that returns UI. Component may have a logic along with UI.

1. Should return JSX
2. Component must be start with capital letter.

```
function HellowWorld(){
    return <h1> Hellofrom Component</h1>
}
```

```
function  App(){
return(
<div className="App">
<user name="dev" age={40} email="dev@gmail.com" />
<user name="bob" age={45} email="bob@gmail.com" />
<user name="Robert" age={60} email="robert@gmail.com" />
</div>
)
}

function User(props){
    return(
        <>
        <h1>name: {props.name} </h1>
        <h2>age: {props.age}</h2>
        <h2>email: {props.email}</h2>
        </>
    )
}
```

- **Assignment 1** : Create a simple React app for **RESUME Builder**. It will be static website. You have to make components like **Resume** as top level and under it - **Skills**, **Education**, **Experience** etc as components. All resume data will be under 1 big JavaScript object like which you can us in components via props. You can fix the number of items in **Skills**, **Education**, **Experience** or any section. Example you can say that only 3 experience items is allowed.

  ```
   resume = {
      experience : [ { year:2012, company:'xyz', role:'something' }],
      education:[ ],
      skills : [ 'react js', 'node js']
      .....
      ...
      }
  ```

  > You can choose any simple HTML layout and convert it to React Components

## Props

### Create Component County and render 4 time, pass the props (name, population, income)

Props are like parameters to a function
We use props to pass the data.

1.  De-structuring Assignment
2.  Import/Export
3.  Spread Operator
4.  Logical AND (&&)
5.  Higher Order functions (map, filter, reduce):

## Chapter 3 - Conditional Rendering & Lists

- **Assignment 1** : Make a simple component which can conditionally render a list with **number** or **alphabets** or **_bullets_** in HTML for number. e..g. use a prop like `layout` for this. Also use a prop `items` for array of items in list.

```
< List layout="numbered" items={items}/>
< List layout="alpha"  items={items}/>
< List layout="bullet"   items={items}/>
```

- **Assignment 2** : This is continuation of previous assignment **RESUME Builder**

  1. In this part you have to make some conditional rendering. Suppose if any section doesn't exist you have to remove that section from **Resume**. Example if `skills` is empty array than don't display `skills` section in Resume.

  2. You have to use `map` in most places where there are arrays. Like **Skills**, **Education**, **Experience** if there are 3 entries, use `map` to display 3 experience items. You don't need fix number of items. Any array can have 1 to 10(or some Limit) any number of items. You can put some Limit, so that your layout is not affected.

  3. Conditionally put some styling to **Resume**. Like `light` theme or `dark` theme or any other way you can switch the CSS layouts.

  ```
   resume = {
      experience : [ { year:2012, company:'xyz', role:'something' }],
      education:[ ],
      skills : [ 'react js', 'node js']
      .....
      ...
      }
  ```

## How to implement CSS in react ?

css modules (import styled from './App.module.css')
(className = {styled.App})

css
StyledComponent
SASS

Tailwind
BootStrap

Any other css Library

## Ternary Operators and Lists

The ternary operator is a simplified conditional operator like if / else.

Syntax: condition ? <expression if true> : <expression if false>

Before

```
if (authenticated) {
  renderApp();
} else {
  renderLogin();
}
```

With Ternary Operator

```
authenticated ? renderApp() : renderLogin();

```

```
function App(){
    const age = 18;
    const isRed = false;
    return(
<div className="App">
{age >= 19 ? <h1>Over age</h1> : <h1> Under Age</h1>}
<h1 color={{color: isRed ? "red" : "green" }}>

</div>
    )
}

export default App;
```

List Example

```
const App = () =>{
const users = [
  {name:"dev", age: 40},
  {name:"John", age: 60},
  {name:"Ramesh", age: 35},
  {name: "Rupesh", age: 60}
]

  return(
    <>
    users.map((obj, key)=>{
      return(
        <User name={obj.name} age={obj.age}  />;
      )
    })

    </>
  )
}


const User =(props)=>{
  return(
    <>
      <h1>{props.name} and {props.age}</h1>
    </>
  )
}

export default App

```

Note: When ever your are creating new component you are creating new file for it.
We can talk more about folder structure in later course.

## Chapter 4 - Events && Event Bubbling

- **Assignment 1** : Make a simple page with 1 Image, 1button, 1 form Input text box and try to apply these events .

  - Image : **onMouseOver** : when you hover on image. Image should increase in size. Think of any way where you can do it. Also, try that when you "move out" the mouse, it should be back to normal size.
  - Button : **onDoubleClick**: when you doubleClick a button. show some alert box. Also make a console.log for single click event. Is console.log printed twice on double click ? check this ?
  - Input Textbox : **onFocus**, **onBlur** are 2 events which occur when you enter or exit an input text box by click of mouse etc. Use it to display some console.log, which print "focused on the textbox", "out of textbox".
  - **onCopy, onCut, onPaste** are 3 events which you can use on any text value etc. try to use it on a paragraph and just alert the user that something is copied, cut or pasted.

- **Assignment 2** : Make a form using `< Form>` tag and put an textbox and button inside this form. try to click the button after entering into textbox. Does form reloads ? Can you try to stop is using `e.preventDefault`. Try it.

- **Assignment 3** : use an Input Textbox : after you enter some text. try to press **ENTER** button and show the an alert or console.log. You can capture the **onKeyPress** event, button how you will you make it work only for "Enter" ? It should not work on pressing of other keys.

- **Assignment 4** : This is continuation of previous assignment **RESUME Builder**.

  - Add a **print** button to print the current resume. You can use a DOM method `window.print` to print the PDF.

- **Assignment 5** : Can you try the challenge of passing the function in one Prop like `onPlay` and the message inside that function to be accessed from other prop `message`.

### Special Assignments ==============

- **Assignment 6** : Using **event bubbling** concept print the name of Parents to Child of any clicked element. It should be order in "**GrandParent >Parent > Child**" this kind of order. Where "Child" represents the current clicked element.

- **Assignment 7** : Make a custom event called **onClose**. this event should close the current browser tab. you can apply it to a button on click or anywhere.

## Chapter 5 - State, useState Hooks

Just think state like a variable, which holds data.

The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.
A component's state can change over time;
whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

- **Assignment 1** : Make a digital **CLOCK** Component using useEffect Hook. We need to only update the time Upto seconds in it. HH:MM:SS format can be used. Can you make it send a Console.log at end of every minute ?

- **Assignment 2** : Implement a simple **TIMER** that displays the elapsed time since the start button was pressed, and it can be stopped and reset. Like a stopwatch.

## useState Hook

A stateof a component is a variable that holds some information that may
change over the lifetime of the component

When the value of the state changes, the component re-renders ifself with updated values.

There are many hook in react all the hook start with use Like useState, useEffect

Example 1

```
import {useState} from 'react

const App = () =>{
  const[age, setAge] = useState(0);
const increaseAge = ()=>{
  setAge(age+1)
}
  return(
    <div className = "App">
      <h1>Age: {age}</h1>
      <button onClick={increaseAge}>Increase Age</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;

```

Example 2

```
import {useState} from 'react

const App = () =>{
  const[inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
const handleChange = (e) =>{
  setInputValue(e.target.value)
}
  return(
    <div className = "App">

      <input type="text" onChange={handleChange}>
      {inputValue}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;

```

note : onChange there is a event is created which is passed to the function as argument and we can capture that in our function as a parameter.

Example 3 (Show/Hide text)

```
import {useState} from 'react

const App = () =>{
  const[showText, setShowText] = useState(false);

  return(
    <div className = "App">
    <button onClick={()=> setShowText(!showText)}> SHOW/HIDE</button>
    {showText ? <h1>This is a text</h1> : ""}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;

```

- note: we can also use conditional operator && = showText && <h1>This is a text</h1>

Example 4:-

```
import {useState} from 'react

function App(){
  const[textColor, setTextColor] = useState("black")

  return(
    <div>
<button onClick={()=> {
  setColor(textColor === 'black' ? "red" : "black")
}}>

<h1 style={{color: textColor}}>Hello This will change the color </h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;

```

## Project - (CRUD Application in react - TODO List App)

## How lifecycle of component work in react

- Lifecycle of the component generally happens from the birth of the component to the death of the component.
- There is 3 different stage in react component lifecycle
- Creating (Mounting) - component appearing in the web page
- Updating - componet update (due to state change or prop update)
- Unmounting - component removed from the page.

Example

```
import React from 'react';

import {useState} from 'react';
function  App(){
  const[showText, setShowText] = useState(false)


return (
  <div>
<button onClick={()=>setShowText(!showText)}>show-hide</button>
{showText && <Text />}
  </div>
)
}

const Test = () =>{
  const[text, setText] = useState("")
  return(
    <div>
    <input type='text' onChange={(e)=>setText(e.target.value)} />
     <h1>{text}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App;

```

## Using the Effect Hook

- Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
- The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

- Run code during the change in life cycle of a component.

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}


```

## What is side effects.

Data fetching, setting up a subscription,
and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects.
Whether or not you’re used to calling these operations “side effects” (or just “effects”),
you’ve likely performed them in your components before.

## Fetch data using useEffect()
